# Reinforcement-Learning-From-Q-Learning-to-Deep-Q-Learning
We provide an introduction to reinforcement learning ( RL ) and explore two key algorithms: Q-Learning
and Deep Q-Learning ( DQL ). RL is a powerful paradigm for training intelligent agents to make sequential
decisions in dynamic environments. Q-Learning, a fundamental RL algorithm, enables an agent to learn an
optimal policy by iteratively updating a value function known as the Q-function. However, as tasks and
state spaces grow complex, traditional Q-Learning faces scalability challenges. To overcome these issues,
DQL combines reinforcement learning with deep neural networks, enabling agents to learn directly from
complex sensory inputs.
